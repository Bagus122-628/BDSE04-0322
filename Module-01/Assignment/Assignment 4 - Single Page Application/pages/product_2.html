    Potato is a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum and is a root
    vegetable native to the Americas. The plant is a perennial in the nightshade
    family Solanaceae. Wild potato species can be found from the southern United
    States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been
    domesticated by Native Americans independently in multiple locations, but
    later genetic studies traced a single origin, in the area of present-day
    southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia.
