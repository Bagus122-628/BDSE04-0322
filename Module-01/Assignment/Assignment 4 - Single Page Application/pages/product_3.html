    Carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, typically orange
    in color, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist, all
    of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to
    Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and
    was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten
    part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also
    eaten. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its enlarged, more
    palatable, less woody-textured taproot.
