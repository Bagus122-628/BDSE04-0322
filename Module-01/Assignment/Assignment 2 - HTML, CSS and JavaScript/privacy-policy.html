          use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow
          them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain
          third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other

          so you can understand the manner in which your personal information
          will be handled by these providers. Certain providers may be located
          in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction
          than either you or us. If you elect to proceed with a transaction that
          involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your
