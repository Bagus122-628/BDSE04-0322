    <section id="privacy-statement">
      <strong>
        1. What information do we collect and what do we do with it?
      </strong>
      <p>
        When you enroll as a student or subscriber (“learner”) on our site or
        related courses, as part of the enrolling process, we collect the
        personal information you give us such as your name and email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Email marketing: we may send you emails about our site and related
        course(s), registration, course content, your course progress or other
        updates. We may also use your email to inform you about changes to the
        course, survey you about your usage, or collect your opinion.
      </p>
      <strong>2. How do you get my consent?</strong>
      <p>
        When you provide us with personal information to become a learner on our
        site, make a purchase, or participate in the course, you imply that you
        consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
        marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent,
        or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
      </p>
      <strong>How do I withdraw my consent?</strong>
      <p>
        If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent
        for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure
        of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at
        <a href="">abclearning@email.com</a>
      </p>
      <strong>3. Disclosure</strong>
      <p>
        We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to
        do so or if you violate our
        <a href="">Terms of service</a>
      </p>
      <strong>4. Third Party Services</strong>
      <p>
        In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use
        and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to
        perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party
        service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
        transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to
        the information we are required to provide to them for your
        purchase-related transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
        so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will
        be handled by these providers. Certain providers may be located in or
        have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either
        you or us. If you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the
        services of a third-party service provider, then your information may
        become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service
        provider or its facilities are located.
      </p>
      <strong>5. Security</strong>
      <p>
        To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and
        follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately
        lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you provide
        us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using
        secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256
        encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or
        electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements
        and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.
      </p>
      <strong>Cookies</strong>
      <p>
        We collect cookies or similar tracking technologies. This means
        information that our website's server transfers to your computer. This
        information can be used to track your session on our website. Cookies
        may also be used to customize our website content for you as an
        individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web browsers,
        you can set up your browser to either let you know when you receive a
        cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.
